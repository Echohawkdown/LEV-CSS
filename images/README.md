# Visual Resources 

The home for the sprites.

## Sprite Consolidation

The current spritesheets for teams and events, among other things, are currently being updated in this [imgur album][teams]. You can find them here as PSD files.

## Sprite Sizing

Currently, the dimensions for icons and thumbs are as follows:

- **Team icons:** 36px by 20px
- **Tournament/Event Thumbnails:** 70px by 50px

## GIMP

While PSD can be read by GIMP, it is not recommended to edit the file since GIMP does not support layer groups and may delete layers on save.

It's recommended you modify all PSD files using Photoshop.
