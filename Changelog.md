**Echohawkdown**

* Cleanup of less files (excluding nightmode less files)
* Incorporation of new thumbnail rules into thumbnails.less
* Incorporation of changes to team icon selectors & rules
* Addition of Riot-approved team tags to teams.less
* Addition of posts.less and header.less, spun out from common.less, in an attempt to make it clearer which rules go where (need clarification on whether the tables should go in common.less or posts.less though)
