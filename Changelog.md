###Echohawkdown

* Cleanup of less files (excluding nightmode less files)
* Simplification of team icon selectors & rules
* Addition of Riot-approved team tags to teams.less
* Addition of posts.less and header.less, spun out from common.less, in an attempt to make it clearer which rules go where (need clarification on whether the tables should go in common.less or posts.less though)

**Incorporation of changes by Simon**

* Hide post ranking
* New thumbnail rules (size, position)
* Post votes have been vertically recentered for new thumbnail size (100x70)
